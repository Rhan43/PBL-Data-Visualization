#Packages required to Stratify Data
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#Package required for graphing
library(plotly)

#Import data: This data was generated from PBL Batch Mode using data: MockPUMF2013.csv, and selecting By Row Measures - Life Expectancy.
LE_df <- read.csv("MockPUMF2013_Calculation_2 - LE by row.csv", header = TRUE)



###STEP 1: Cleaning the data
#The first column name was imported incorrectly. This step changes the name back to how it's supposed to be. 
colnames(LE_df)[colnames(LE_df)=="Ã¯..SMKDSTY"] <- "SMKDSTY"

#Have to change categorical variables in to dummy variables (factors). If they are not changed the graph will be incorrect.
LE_df$SMKDSTY <- as.factor(LE_df$SMKDSTY)
LE_df$DHH_SEX <- as.factor(LE_df$DHH_SEX)
LE_df$EDUDR04 <- as.factor(LE_df$EDUDR04)

#To make life easier I made a dataset with only the columns I needed.
LE_clean <- LE_df %>%
  select(SMKDSTY, DHH_SEX, EDUDR04, ByRowLifeExpectancy)



###STEP 2: Manipulate the data: stratify, calculate the mean, and split:
LE_3 <- LE_clean %>%  
  group_by(DHH_SEX, SMKDSTY, EDUDR04) %>% #Grouped individuals based on thier levels of Sex, Smoking Status, and Education Level
  summarise(avg_LE = mean(ByRowLifeExpectancy)) #Calculated the mean LE for each combination of strata levels


#In order to plot 3 stratified variables, you need to seperate the data into n subsets where n is the number of levels within one stratified variable.
#In this example I used the stratified variable: DDH_SEX which has two levels (1-Male, 2-Female). Therefore I seperated the data into two subsets one with only Male data and the other with only Female data
LE_3_M <- subset(LE_3, DHH_SEX == 1) #Male only
LE_3_F <- subset(LE_3, DHH_SEX != 1) #Female only



###STEP 3: Plot data seperately and then together:
#Created a plot for the Male data. 
#y=~ education level column (e.g. column 1 corresponds to label Post Secondary Graduate) 
p3M <- LE_3_M %>%
  arrange(EDUDR04) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~SMKDSTY, color= ~EDUDR04, legendgroup = ~EDUDR04) %>%
  add_bars(y=~avg_LE)
p3M

#Created a plot for the Female Data. 
p3F <- LE_3_F %>%
  arrange(EDUDR04) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~SMKDSTY, color= ~EDUDR04, legendgroup = ~EDUDR04) %>%
  add_bars(y=~avg_LE, showlegend = FALSE)
p3F


#Combined Male plot and Female plot
p3 <- subplot(p3M, p3F, nrows = 1) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Smoke Status in Males'), 
         yaxis = list(title= 'Life Expectancy (Years)'),
         xaxis2 = list(title = 'Smoke Status in Females'))
p3
